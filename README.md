# React with Router, Redux, and using TypeScript

## Who is this for?
Me mostly, but anyone who has a little experience with React/Redux/Router looking to try out typescript might get a little bit of use out of this avoiding some of the pitfalls that I ran into using redux4, and having all the tutorials lacking when it comes to refactoring your reducers/actions

## What is this?
This is a starting point for any app that is wanting to use those 4 technologies. This project started out from the MS Typescript/react tutorial. [Start There](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter). This was created to hopefully help anyone having trouble getting a little further. That tutorial is great, but it hasn't been updated for Redux v4, and doesn't have anything for Router. This app displays how to use those, and how everything else connects to it.

## Is this the only way?
No. It's probably not even the best way, but it's A way! And it works! (currently).
